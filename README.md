cd poc

# Create another vite react app bravo
nx g @nx/react:application apps/poc-react-app-bravo

# Try to build all apps
npx nx run-many -t build

# Create a shared react component library
nx g @nx/react:library lib/poc-react-shared-components --appProject=poc-react-app-alpha

# Create an electron forge application on apps
npm init electron-app@latest poc-electron-forge-react -- --template=vite-typescript

# Add react-dom and react types to electron forge project
npm install --save react react-dom
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
```

## Electron

### Ubuntu

The following were needed so at least it works on my Ubuntu WSL.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libnss3-dev libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-dev libcups2 libgtk-3-dev libasound2
```

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨


## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve poc-react-app-alpha`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
